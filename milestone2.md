# Milestone2

### Writeup

Our idea is similar to the second proposal point from Milestone1, which involves an inventory site geared towards small business owners. We have adapted the same functional pages of "viewing inventory", "checking out inventory" and "adding new inventory" as our initial proposal. This app was originally created with the intent of using a barcode scanner to scan the item's barcode number. Since we are creating a mobile web-application, we are including two options for the user when checking out or adding in inventory, an option to manually type in their item's barcode number and another option for scanning the physical barcode using either a mobile camera or through a computer's web cam.
