# Milestone2

### Writeup

Our idea is similar to the second proposal point from Milestone1, which involves an inventory site geared towards small business owners. We have adapted the same functional pages of "viewing inventory", "checking out inventory" and "adding new inventory" as our initial proposal. This app was originally created with the intent of using a barcode scanner to scan the item's barcode number. Since we are creating a web application instead of a mobile application, we decided to have the user manually type in the barcode instead. The screenshots below are similar to the paper prototype version in that they both have three buttons for view inventory, add item and checkout item. We changed the layout of the view inventory so that it would be item cards, instead of just having a long list of information. Add item and checkout item in the new screenshots is for the user to manually input the item name, barcode, the amount added/checked out and the units of measurements.
